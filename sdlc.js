// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const AnalysisofRequirements = "This is the second step, which is the process of determining user expectations for a new or modified product. These features, called requirements, must be quantifiable, relevant and detailed"
const Design = "This is the third step, which is the process of envisioning and defining software solutions to one or more sets of problems."
const Implementation = "This is the fourth step, which includes user notification, user training, installation of hardware, installation of software onto production computers, and integration of the system into daily work processes. "
const TestingandIntergration = "This is the fifth step, which is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group."
const Maintain = "This is the final step, which is where the software is monitored to ensure it continues to function as it was designed to, and repairs or upgrades are performed as needed"
